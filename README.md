# **Email Spam Classifier 📧**

### **Overview**  
The **Email Spam Classifier** helps users identify whether an email is **spam** or **ham** (not spam) based on its content. Built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, this interactive app leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** to classify emails and filter out unwanted messages effectively.

## **Features** ✨  
✅ **Spam Classification** – Classify incoming emails as **spam** or **ham** (legitimate).  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Interactive charts and graphs to explore spam email patterns and features.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Uses advanced NLP algorithms and classifiers (like **Naive Bayes**, **SVM**, etc.) to predict email labels.  
✅ **User-Friendly UI** – Easy-to-use interface powered by **Streamlit** for seamless user experience.  
✅ **Email Filtering** – Filter spam emails based on the model’s predictions.

## **How It Works? 🤔**  
1️⃣ **User Inputs Email Content** – Paste an email or upload a file to check for spam.  
2️⃣ **Text Preprocessing** – The app processes the email text to remove stopwords, special characters, and other irrelevant information.  
3️⃣ **Machine Learning Model** – The pre-trained spam classification model predicts whether the email is spam or ham based on its content.  
4️⃣ **Results & Visualization** – Displays the prediction with confidence scores and visualizations of important email features, such as word frequency distributions.

## **Example Use Case 📧**  
🔹 A user receives an **unknown email** and is unsure whether it's spam.  
🔹 The user copies the email content into the app, which predicts whether the email is **spam** or **ham**.  
🔹 The app provides a confidence score to help the user make a more informed decision.  
🔹 The user can view important terms contributing to the prediction and **filter spam emails** more effectively.

---

## **Future Enhancements 🚀**  
🔹 **Integration with Real Email Servers** (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) to automatically classify incoming emails.  
🔹 **User Authentication** to track and save classified emails for future reference.  
🔹 **Advanced NLP Models** for better accuracy, such as **BERT** or **GPT-based models**.  
🔹 **Customizable Spam Filter** to allow users to modify or train their own classifier.
